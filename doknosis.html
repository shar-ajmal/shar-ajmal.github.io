                        Doknosis is an AI assistant that help doctors by giving them suggestions on potential illnesses a patient has based on information collected during the patient visit. It records the conversation between the doctor and the patient, picks up keywords, and uses an algorithm to list possible diseases. Doknosis integrates into the doctors note by filling out the note with important information and presenting a list of possible diseases. This way the doctor doesn't need to break his flow by accessing a different system. Doknosis can help doctors diagnose patients more accurately because they can compare their thoughts with a separate system.

                        I was brought on the doknosis team to bridge the gap between design and engineering. There was already an engineer and a designer working on the project, but there no one to coordinate between both domains. I worked on creating paper protoypes, wireframes, and storyboards with the designer. I coordinated with the engineer to build the web prototype using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I also conducted user tests on doctors and pre-med students to test our prototype and iterate on the design. I also created affinity diagrams with the team to synthesize our interview and testing data.
